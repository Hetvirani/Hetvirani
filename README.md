### 🌟 Projects

#### 🔹 SamajConnect – Community Management App  
- Developed during internship at **BISAG-N**, SamajConnect is an Android app that allows users to create and manage *Samaj* (community) groups.  
- member profiles update.
- A key highlight is the dynamic tree-based relationship mapping using Canvas, enabling users to send/accept familial relation requests and visualize generation-wise structure.  
<sub><sup>Technologies: Java, Android, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, RESTFUL API</sup></sub>

---

#### 🔹 16-bit CPU Design using Logisim  
- Designed a **16-bit CPU** using Logisim, integrating data bus and multiple 16-bit and 12-bit registers.  
- Developed **ALU**, control unit, and a common bus system for performing arithmetic, logical, and control operations.  
- Successfully executed instructions like addition, subtraction, and logic gates.  
<sub><sup>Technologies: Logisim, Digital Logic Design</sup></sub>

---

#### 🔹 Real-Time Embedded Voting System  
- Designed and implemented a **real-time embedded voting system** on AVR microcontroller with integrated LCD, keypad, and LED interfaces.  
- Integrated **hardware timer interrupts** to enforce user action timeouts and optimize system responsiveness.  
- Utilized GPIO and **interrupt-driven routines** for secure keypad input and real-time display updates.  
- Built robust logic for user authentication, voting validation, and system state management.  
<sub><sup>Technologies: C, AVR, Embedded Systems</sup></sub>

---

#### 🔹 BPSK Modulation Hardware Circuit  
- Designed and tested a **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)** circuit for digital communication using discrete hardware.

---

#### 🔹 Travel Agency Website  
- Designed and developed a **travel agency website** offering vacation packages, destination info, hotel listings, and transport options.  
- Built an interactive and responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Implemented booking flow and showcased travel packages simulating real-world scenarios.  
<sub><sup>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</sup></sub>

---

#### 🔹 Electrically Small Antenna for GPS & WLAN  
- Researched and simulated a **low-profile dual-band antenna** resonating at 1.5 GHz and 3.7 GHz for GPS and WLAN.  
- Compact design (38 mm × 34 mm) with a circular loop + rectangular bars on a **polyimide substrate** (εr = 3.4).  
- Analyzed key parameters like S11, VSWR, and radiation patterns in **Ansys HFSS**.
