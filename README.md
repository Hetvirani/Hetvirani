### 🌟 Projects

- **SamajConnect – Community Management App**  
      -Developed during internship at Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG
    N), SamajConnect is an Android app that allows users to create and manage Samaj (community) groups.

      -Features include real-time notifications, event donations, and member profiles. A key highlight is the dynamic tree-based rela
    tionship mapping using Canvas, enabling users to send/accept familial relation requests and visualize generation-wise
     structure.  
  <sub><sup>Technologies: Java, Android, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, RESTFUL API</sup></sub>

- **16-bit CPU Design using Logisim**  
      -Designed a 16-bit CPU using Logisim, integrating data bus and multiple 16-bit and 12-bit registers for efficient data
     transfer and storage.

     -Developed Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), control unit, and a common bus system to perform
     arithmetic, logical, and control operations. Successfully executed instructions like addition, subtraction, and logic gates.

     -This project deepened understanding of CPU architecture, register design, and internal data flow.
  <sub><sup>Technologies: Logisim, Digital Logic Design</sup></sub>

- **Real-Time Embedded Voting System**  
      - Designed and implemented a real-time embedded voting system on AVR microcontroller with integrated LCD, 
    keypad, and LED interfaces in C. February 2025
  
      – Integrated hardware timer interrupts to enforce user action timeouts, initiate event-driven reminders, and 
    optimize system responsiveness.
  
      – Utilized GPIO and interrupt-driven routines for secure, debounced keypad input and physical display updates.
  
      – Developed robust user authentication, voting validation, and system state management logic for reliable multi-user 
    operation. 
  <sub><sup>Technologies: C, AVR, Embedded Systems</sup></sub>

- **BPSK Modulation Hardware Circuit**  
  Designed and tested a Binary Phase Shift Keying circuit for digital communications using discrete hardware.

- **Travel Agency Website**  
    -Designed and developed a travel agency website offering vacation packages, destination information, hotel listings,
     and transport options.
    
    -Focused on user experience with an interactive, responsive UI built using HTML, CSS, and
     JavaScript.
    
    -Implemented booking flow and showcased travel packages to simulate real-world travel booking systems.
  <sub><sup>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</sup></sub>

- **Design and Simulation of a Low-Profile Electrically Small Antenna for GPS and WLAN**  
    – Researched, designed, and simulated a dual-band electrically small antenna resonating at 1.5 GHz and 3.7 GHz for 
    GPS and WLAN applications.
    
    – The compact design (38 mm × 34 mm) utilized a circular loop with three rectangular bars on a polyimide substrate 
    (εr = 3.4, thickness = 0.1 mm).
    
    – Key parameters like S11, VSWR, and radiation patterns were analyzed, demonstrating effective impedance matching 
      and omnidirectional performance using ansys.
